Easy Gentoo
===========

Bash script for easy Gentoo installation

"Easy Gentoo" is a bash script, which is basically a combination of
Gentoo Handbook steps, that installs Gentoo Linux from a stage3 tarball.
The overall procedure is unattended, everything is handled by script.
Installation includes "localization (English and Turkish), kernel
compilation, X server setup, desktop environment setup (Xfce)" and more.
These steps are enabled or disabled according to a profile.

Profile is a simple text file which has the necessary options, settings
etc. for the installation. (Profile must be named as "profile") With
a proper profile, it is possible to have a basic system (without X) or
an Xfce desktop with a few key strokes.

"Easy Gentoo" was tested on lots of machines with different profiles.
Many successful installations were made. Hope it becomes a time-saver
for you. Happy compiling!
